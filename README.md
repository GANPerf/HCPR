------------
Code for our paper **'Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Hypothesis Consolidation of Prediction Rationale'**

Retrieve the VisDA dataset and update the code path accordingly. Begin by training the model on the source domain using the src_pretrain.py script. For source-free domain adaptation, execute the tar_adaptation_rationale.py script directly.

To compare results using SHOT as rationale and adacontrastive, run tar_adaptation_SHOT_as_rationale.py and tar_adaptation_ctr.py, respectively.
